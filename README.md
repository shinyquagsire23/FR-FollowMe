Apply hooks as usual, but replace the two bytes at 08062986, 080629D6, 08062A8E, 08062B46, 08062BFE, 08062CAE, 08062CFE, and 08062DB6 with 02 21 (mov r1, #0x2). This makes it so that the "Copy Player" movement type will actually do what it says (without the modifications it will rotate it's copying orientation). The hooks will make it so that instead of copying the player's current move, it will echo his/her last move instead.
